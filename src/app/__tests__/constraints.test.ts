// We'll use a tiny vocab of 5-letter words. Scenario:
// Vocab: crane, trace, react, cater, caret, crate
// History step 1: guess CRANE with pattern 01200 (c absent, r present, a correct, n absent, e absent)
//   Means: position2 letter r somewhere else, a fixed at pos3, c/e/n not in word (except r somewhere else)
// History step 2: guess REACT with pattern 12021 (r present (wrong spot), e correct? etc.) -> We'll craft patterns logically.
// For clarity we will compute expected survivors manually for chosen patterns.
// NOTE: Patterns here are hypothetical and may not correspond to real feedback of a consistent secret; \n// The test only checks we reapply filtering deterministically.
